# Patient_fall_detectio_system

In this project our team developed a patient fall detection system, using arduinos, ultrasonic sensors and rf transmitters.
We wanted to not have any wires on the patient so we opted to use ultrasonic sensors rather than accelerometers.
Once the system detects the patient on the ground it sends a signal using the rf module to the nurse alert system, which is another arduino with a buzzer.
